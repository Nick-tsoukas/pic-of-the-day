categories 
are the types of events by which individual events are cataloged .
Cats can be used to filter the output of the categories and the layers api 
the acceptable cats can be accessed via the cat json 

this is the end point I want to work with 

nasa.ob/api/v2.1/events 

add the status query 
how can I get both open and closed events 

Get open and closed 



Request has a query property and you can access it with request.query
The first query begins with ? and any other queries will be proceeded by the $ key 

EONET 

can you search events by catagories ?

return res.send will end the response at that code block. This is a common express pattern 

building http endpoint
